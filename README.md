<h4>One of my favourite subjects has always been research. This specific research idea had been enticing me for over a year. I've always wanted to focus on it but haven't had the motivation anytime.

Sudipta has always been a good friend of mine for nearly 15 years now. We have been tuition mates, members of same club, competitors, and what not during our school years. Doing something in college with one of my schoolmates has always been in my bucket list.

All of this changed when Shilanjoy Da offered me this chance to participate in the #poster presentation competition organised by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/spie.uemk">SPIE OSA UEM Kolkata Student Chapter</a>.

When I proposed the poster idea to him (Sudipta), he was immediately enthusiastic. I made the decision that it was now or never. We planned and designed the poster over the course, working until 4 a.m at times. With all our efforts, we were finally able to get the work ready.</h4>
